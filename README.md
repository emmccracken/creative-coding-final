Title: Chromesthesia Concert  

Artist: Lizzie McCracken   

Description: Chromesthesia Concert is an example of using a color sensor and an Arduino to replicate Chromesthesia (sound-to-color synesthesia). Synesthesia is when one sensory or cognitive pathway stimulates involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. Chromosthesia, particularly, is related to colors and sounds- in this case, specific musical notes. Everyone with this condition can associate different sounds or notes with different colors, but in the case of this project, it uses Isaac Newton's belief that the colors of the rainbow represent the seven musical notes on a scale. This piece detects the color being shown and plays the according musical note, allowing the audience to create their own songs or tunes through color.
