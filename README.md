Assignment 4: Interactive Creative Coding Final Project (15 Points)   
Due: Finals Period (Beginning of Class)  
Use one of more of the technologies demonstrated in class to build an Interactive Creating Coding project that realizes ideas and/or concepts of your own that you find interesting. JavaScript, P5.js, Max, and Arduino are all available platforms, but other may be considered. In order to make your project interactive consider using sound, video, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, motion sensors, photo diodes, photo resistors, thermostats, datasets, streaming data, or other methods / sensors. Projection, animation, generative behaviors, Perlin Noise, data visualization, and data sonification are all possible avenues for your ideas.  


Requirements:
1. Use JavaScript, P5.js, Max, and/or Arduino to create an Interactive Creative Coding project
2. Add three or more forms of interaction as described above
3. Produce your project so that it can be displayed or performed in an exhibition
4. Consider making use of projection, animation, Perlin noise, and/or data visualization/sonification
5. Be prepared to present or perform your work during the finals period

Assignment 4: Final Project Abstract  

Please post a title, author, and abstract for your Assignment 4: Interactive Creative Coding Final Project as a text submission to this assignment. The abstract is a paragraph of text that describes conceptual and technical aspects of your project. This content will be printed on cards to display next to your piece during the final project exhibition.

Title: Chromesthesia Concert  

Artist: Lizzie McCracken   

Description: Chromesthesia Concert is an example of using a color sensor and an Arduino to replicate Chromesthesia (sound-to-color synesthesia). Synesthesia is when one sensory or cognitive pathway stimulates involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. Chromosthesia, particularly, is related to colors and sounds- in this case, specific musical notes. Everyone with this condition can associate different sounds or notes with different colors, but in the case of this project, it uses Isaac Newton's belief that the colors of the rainbow represent the seven musical notes on a scale. This piece detects the color being shown and plays the according musical note, allowing the audience to create their own songs or tunes through color.

I used a combination of an Arduino, color sensor, and a speaker, to accomplish this task. The calibration of the color sensor was difficult- and I utilized some skeleton  code I found online at https://lastminuteengineers.com/tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor-arduino-tutorial/ to get me started. Then I had to code values for more than just RGB, and ended up with a fully functioning rainbow piano. I showcased this at my Creative Coding class's final exhibition, and had colored sheet music I created for attendees to test my project. I also had my Arduino code pulled up, which was printing the color it sensed while playing its according musical note.
