Title: Chromesthesia Concert  

Artist: Lizzie McCracken   

Description: Chromesthesia Concert is an example of using a color sensor and an Arduino to replicate Chromesthesia (sound-to-color synesthesia). Synesthesia is when one sensory or cognitive pathway stimulates involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. Chromosthesia, particularly, is related to colors and sounds- in this case, specific musical notes. Everyone with this condition can associate different sounds or notes with different colors, but in the case of this project, it uses Isaac Newton's belief that the colors of the rainbow represent the seven musical notes on a scale. This piece detects the color being shown and plays the according musical note, allowing the audience to create their own songs or tunes through color.


I used a combination of an Arduino, color sensor, and a speaker, to accomplish this task. The calibration of the color sensor was difficult- and I utilized some skeleton  code I found online at https://lastminuteengineers.com/tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor-arduino-tutorial/ to get me started. Then I had to code values for more than just RGB, and ended up with a fully functioning rainbow piano. I showcased this at my Creative Coding class's final exhibition, and had colored sheet music I created for attendees to test my project. I also had my Arduino code pulled up, which was printing the color it sensed while playing its according musical note.
